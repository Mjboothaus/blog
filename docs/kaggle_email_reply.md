Subject: [Kaggle Forums] New post: Errors in the Titanic Warm-up Competition dataset (train.csv and test.csv)

Myles O'Neill writes—

Cool article, you should share the Titanic-Facts dataset on Kaggle and then write up a kernel to compare differences in the datasets, I think that would be a really cool thing to see.

As for the competition, its main purpose is to teach data science in a simple way - the accuracy of the data in the tutorial problem isn't really a problem in this regard.

It would be really cool to see how the various kernels on the titanic competition would change if they were applied to the alternative Titanic Facts data instead of the 1999 Encyclopedia Titanica data!
